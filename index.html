<p>Unfortunately the external flight sim displays you can buy are either prohibitively expensive
or inadequate to the task. Having spent a few hundred pounds (sterling) on a "flight panel"
(radio, autopilot, switches, flight instrument displays, etc) I found that, unfortunately, it 
was impractical to have them all connected as they consumed more power than my computer or
even most USB hubs could provide - in addition they didn't work very well with my flight sim
of choice, having buggy and difficult to use drivers, and wouldn't work at all with FlightGear,
the excellent open source flight simulator I also like to use.</p>

<p>This project, Pivionics, was conceived to address that. Pivionics should allow anyone to use a
modest spec computer (hopefully such as the Raspberry Pi) to produce an elegant, configurable
physical display interface for use with flight simulators. I'm not a games programmer, so it's
probably not going to be the most efficient code, but I hope my 20+ years experience as a
programmer will allow me to make it functional and solid.</p>

<p>If you are reading this hoping to instantly get up and running, sorry - at this stage I have
comitted to github only as a backup of my local repository - I'm currently building the
graphical system on which Pivionics will be based and it can't actually be used for its
intended purpose yet (no mechanism to receive and interpret data from your flight sim). Do,
however, keep an eye on the project as I have got the basics of this graphics system working
and hopefully will soon be able to start adding such functionality.</p>

<p>In addition, some of you looking for SDL2 examples may find my work helpful, or you may wish
to point out something I'm not doing right (as I said, I'm not a game programmer so SDL2 is a
bit new to me!)</p>

<p>If all this hasn't scared you off, then please feel free to take a look and use this source
however you see fit (in accordance with the GPL).</p>
