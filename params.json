Having spent a few hundred pounds (sterling) on a \"flight panel\"\r\n(radio, autopilot, switches, flight instrument displays, etc) I found that, unfortunately, it \r\nwas impractical to have them all connected as they consumed more power than my computer or\r\neven most USB hubs could provide - in addition they didn't work very well with my flight sim\r\nof choice, having buggy and difficult to use drivers, and wouldn't work at all with FlightGear,\r\nthe excellent open source flight simulator I also like to use.\r\n\r\nThis project, Pivionics, was conceived to address that. Pivionics should allow anyone to use a\r\nmodest spec computer (hopefully such as the Raspberry Pi) to produce an elegant, configurable\r\nphysical display interface for use with flight simulators. I'm not a games programmer, so it's\r\nprobably not going to be the most efficient code, but I hope my 20+ years experience as a\r\nprogrammer will allow me to make it functional and solid.\r\n\r\nIf you are reading this hoping to instantly get up and running, sorry - at this stage I have\r\ncomitted to github only as a backup of my local repository - I'm currently building the\r\ngraphical system on which Pivionics will be based and it can't actually be used for its\r\nintended purpose yet (no mechanism to receive and interpret data from your flight sim). Do,\r\nhowever, keep an eye on the project as I have got the basics of this graphics system working\r\nand hopefully will soon be able to start adding such functionality.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some of you looking for SDL2 examples may find my work helpful, or you may wish\r\nto point out something I'm not doing right (as I said, I'm not a game programmer so SDL2 is a\r\nbit new to me!)\r\n\r\nIf all this hasn't scared you off, then please feel free to take a look and use this source\r\nhowever you see fit (in accordance with the GPL).\r\n\r\n### For more information head to [The Pivionics Wiki](https://github.com/SteJay/pivionics/wiki)",
